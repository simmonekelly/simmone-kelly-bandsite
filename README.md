# simmone-kelly-bandsite

## Project Overview
For our second project we were tasked with creating a site for an up-and-coming band. The project was be split into 3 parts (sprints of 1 week each). You will be required to build a website with all the required functionality over the next 3 weeks. Each week has a required deliverable. Creative mock ups and design specs will be provided, and your task is to use the mock ups and requirements to create a fully functional live site for the band.

### Sprint 1:
For this sprint, we focused on building a responsive website based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

### Sprint 2:
For this sprint, we were provided some updated mock ups for an additional screen that will be part of the site, as well as some new features to be added. 
Our goal was to make the site interactive using JavaScript, and to add a second page to the site according to the mockups and design specs.

### Sprint 3:
There is now a working API that for us use to connect your front-end code to the back-end and get live data from the server. We were tasked to now make the site functional with comments and shows data from the server, where before we had hard-coded mock data.

## Tools & Resources
- Make use of a design package (assets, style guide, and creative mockup) to create a functional and responsive site.
- Use Sass to compile the projectâ€™s CSS

## Functional Requirements
### Comments Section
- Users must be able to add new comments that are stored on the back-end using the API.
- New comments that are added must be displayed with the existing comments, the newest comments being at the top.
- The Bio Page must not reload when comments are added.
- The comments must be added such that the newest comments are at the top.
- 3 Default comments must be displayed when the page first loads by retrieveing comment data from the provided API and display it on the page.

### Shows Page
- Must display the shows data retrieved from the API.

## Visual Design Requirements
- The site must closely resemble the mockups and design specs provided in the design package.
- The site must be responsive at all dimensions, including between, above & below the provided break-points
- The site must be approached using a mobile-first design approach.


## Implementation Requirements
- The project's CSS must be derived from Sass and use any Sass features that make the code more concise and reusable, such as variables or mixins.
- The CSS classes must use BEM principles.
- The site must use Flexbox for layout control.
- The site must use axios (imported using a CDN) for the API HTTP requests.
- We must use addEventListener to register your event handler functions, instead of using HTML onsubmit/onclickattributes.
